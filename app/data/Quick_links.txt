Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale:

1 to 5 rating system that categorizes hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds. The primary purpose of the scale is to estimate potential property damage.

Hurricane Categories & Potential Damage

Category 1
Sustained Winds: 74-95 mph
Damage: "Very dangerous winds will produce some damage." Expect damage to roofs, shingles, and siding of well-constructed homes. Large tree branches will snap.

Category 2
Sustained Winds: 96-110 mph
Damage: "Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage." Well-constructed homes could see major roof and siding damage. Many trees will be uprooted, and a near-total power loss is expected.

Category 3 (Major Hurricane)
Sustained Winds: 111-129 mph
Damage: "Devastating damage will occur." Well-built homes may have major damage, including the removal of roof decking. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks.

Category 4 (Major Hurricane)
Sustained Winds: 130-156 mph
Damage: "Catastrophic damage will occur." Homes can sustain severe damage, including the loss of the roof and some exterior walls. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months.

Category 5 (Major Hurricane)
Sustained Winds: 157 mph or higher
Damage: "Catastrophic damage will occur." A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed. The area will be isolated by fallen trees and power poles, and most of it will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
