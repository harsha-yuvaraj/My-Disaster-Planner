        Key Evacuation Tips
        </h2>

    <h4>Communication is Key</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stay calm and use simple, direct statements; the person you are caring for will respond to the tone you set. Instead of correcting them, use affirmation and reassurance.
        </li>
        <li>
            Know what specifically provides comfort to your loved one, whether it's holding their hand, listening to certain music, or looking at familiar photos.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consider carrying an Alzheimer's Association Companion Card to discreetly inform others that your companion may need extra help and patience.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Plan Their Route & Meeting Place</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
           When planning the route, consider how long the person you care for can sit comfortably and how much fuel it will take to get there.
        </li>
        <li>
           Share this evacuation plan with your or the care recipient's support circle, and be sure to include at least one contact who lives outside the disaster area.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose a safe meeting place outside and far away from their home where everyone can gather after leaving.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Maintain Their Routines & Provide Comfort</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
           During the disruption, try to maintain their normal routines as much as possible, especially for eating and medication.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be sure to pack familiar items that will provide comfort to them, such as a favorite blanket, a stuffed toy, or games.
        </li>

        <h4>Communication is Key</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Stay calm and think clearly by using simple, direct internal thoughts. The tone you set for yourself can influence your response. Instead of second-guessing, focus on affirmation and reassurance.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Keep a card with your emergency contact information and any important medical notes in your wallet or Go-Kit to easily share with first responders if needed.
